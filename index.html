            <h1>This is About Power</h1>
            <p>In physics, power is the amount of energy transferred or converted per unit time. In the International System of Units, the unit of power is the watt, equal to one joule per second. In older works, power is sometimes called activity. Power is a scalar quantity The output power of a motor is the product of the torque that the motor generates and the angular velocity of its output shaft. The power involved in moving a ground vehicle is the product of the traction force on the wheels and the velocity of the vehicle. In classical mechanics, as quantified from a stationary frame of reference, the motive power of a jet-propelled vehicle is the product of the engine thrust and the velocity of the vehicle (note that by this definition, a propelled vehicle hovering at stationary elevation over a gravitational body, where the upward thrust exactly cancels the downward acceleration of gravity, the motive power is zero). The rate</p>
